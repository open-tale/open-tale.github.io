# Welcome to Open Tale

Open Tale is a [Tabletop RPG][ttrpg] system. It has *Open* in its name for two
reasons:

1. It's open source
2. It separates mechanics from narratives, leaving the story completely open

This initiative was inspired by [Open Legend][open-legend]. There will be some
similarities but also some core changes. The first noticeable change is the
distribution license.

## Contributing

This website is managed on a [Github repository][repository]. Thus, any kind of
