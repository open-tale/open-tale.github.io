# Welcome to Open Tale

Open Tale is a [Tabletop RPG][ttrpg] system. It has *Open* in its name for two
reasons:

1. It's open source
2. It separates mechanics from narratives, leaving the story completely open

This initiative was inspired by [Open Legend][open-legend]. There will be some
similarities but also some core changes.

The first noticeable difference is the distribution license. Open Tale is
released under the [Apache License 2.0][apache], granting the community much
more freedom of use.

## Contributing

This website is managed on a [Github repository][repository]. Thus, any kind of
contribution needs to be done there with the tools the the interface provide.

If you want to help us, feel free to:

* Open an [issue][issue]
* Fork the repository
* Open a [pull request][pull-request]
