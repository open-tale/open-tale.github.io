# Welcome to Open Tale!

Open Tale is a free and open source [Tabletop RPG][ttrpg] system that
separates mechanics from narratives, leaving the story completely open for
creation. It is released under the [Apache License 2.0][apache], granting the
community the freedom to fork, tweak and publish it.

Although Open Tale focuses on providing a fair system with interesting
mathematical unfoldings, there must be a strong commitment to simplicity,
dynamism and flexibility. When we're gathered around a table to play RPGs, we
want to be amazed by innovative stories and epic battles. We want to feel the
impact of great challenges. We want to laugh and be surprised.

Such emotions require a certain timing that can easily be lost if the players
have to constantly check the ruleset to make sure that nobody is breaking the
system. Therefore, Open Tale is aligned with a call for uninterruptible fun.
