# 6. Items

There are two kinds of items in Open Tale, gears and objects. The distinction
between them is fairly simple: gears can be equiped and objects cannot.

The number of non-equiped items that a character can carry is determined by
the Capacity quality. Also, characters can only carry one bulky/dense item at a
time. If the carried item is too big, the character becomes unable to perform
combative moves. If the item is just too heavy, such as gold bars, the
Disadvantage modifier should be applied on all rolls. But ultimately, these
decisions are up to the GM.

## 6.1. Gears

Since gears can alter the capabilities of characters when equiped, they deserve
special attention. First, gears may have descriptions indicating changes on
the character's attributes, attack, defense, range limit etc when equiped.
Second, as in most RPGs, there are weapons and wearable gears.
