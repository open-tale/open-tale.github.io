# 6. Items

There are three kinds of items in Open Tale, gears, consumables and objects. The
distinction between them is fairly simple: gears can be equiped, consumables
can be spent and objects can just get in and out of the character's inventory.

The number of non-equiped items that a character can carry is determined by
the Capacity quality. Also, characters can only carry one bulky/dense item at a
time. If the carried item is too big, the character becomes unable to perform
combative moves. If the item is just too heavy, such as gold bars, the
Disadvantage modifier should be applied on all rolls. But ultimately, these
decisions are up to the GM.

#### No ammo!

Yes, that's right. Ammo can be a bothersome detail that distract players from
the actual fun. What's the point of stopping in the middle of an adventure to go
back to town to buy more arrows? In Open Tale, it's subtended that the character
always carries enough ammunition.

## 6.1. Gears

Since gears can alter the capabilities of characters when equiped, they deserve
special attention. First, gears may have descriptions indicating changes on the
character's attributes, attack, defense, range limit etc when equiped. Second,
as in most RPGs, there are wearable gears and weapons. Let's see how weapons
work.

### 6.1.1. Weapons

Weapons have two basic properties: range and size. They determine whether the
weapon can be used for dual wielding or not, if two hands are required to use it
and the attribute to roll for when attacking with the weapon:

| Range | Size | Dual wield | Two-handed | Roll for | Example
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
| Short | Medium | Yes | No | Strength | Katana, Mace
| Short | Long | No | Yes | Strength | Long Sword, Magic Staff
| Short | Short | Yes | No | Dexterity | Dagger, Knife
| Long | ~ | No | Yes | Dexterity | Bow

When dual wielding weapons that are based on different attributes (e.g.: a sword
and a dagger), the player should roll for the smallest attribute between the
character's Strength and Dexterity.
