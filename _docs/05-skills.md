## 5.2. Passive skills

### 5.2.1. Close-range combat

the player may choose another target. Upon choosing it, the character moves
towards it and, if possible, attacks it with another close-range attack.

The path towards the new target must be the shortest known one. The score for
the movement range is calculated with a new roll for Motion and the damage dealt
to the new target is equal to the excess of damage dealt to the previous one,
piercing the new target's Defense.

#### Dash Attack

When performing a close-range attack on a target right after moving from a cell
that is not adjacent to that target to a cell that is  adjacent to that target,
the AP gets a bonus of 1 point.

Dash Attacks can hit multiple targets if the restrictions are satisfied.

#### Side Slash

When performing a close-range attack on a target right after moving from a cell
that is adjacent to that target to another cell that is also adjacent to that
target, the AP gets a bonus of 1 point.

Side Slashes can hit multiple targets if the restrictions are satisfied.

#### Vengeful Scar

On the first turn after getting hit by a long-range attack, the character rolls
for Motion with a Superiority modifier if moving towards the attacker through
the shortest known path.

#### Confident Blow

On the first turn after completely defending an attack or a skill from a target,
when attacking that same target, apply the Superiority roll modifier.

#### Made of Stone

Upon completelly defending an attack or a skill, the character's Defense is
increased by 1 until the beginning of its next turn.

#### Defensive Nerves

Upon completelly defending an attack or a skill, the character is healed by 1
point. If the agressor rolled with an Advantage modifier, the healing amount
is 2, instead. If the agressor rolled with a Superiority modifier, the healing
amount is 3, instead.

#### Die Hard

If the character's health is below one quarter of its maximum Health Points, add
one third of its Strength to the character's Defense.

### 5.2.2. Long-range combat

#### The Running Shooter

The character can move and attack with a long-range weapon at the same time. To
do so, roll for Motion and then roll for Dexterity. Choose the character's
destination, the cell from which the character will shoot and the target.

#### Deadly Tower

If the character hasn't moved since the last attack with a long-range weapon,
when rolling for Dexterity to perfor an attack with a long-range weapon, add 1
extra point to the AP. This (cummulative) effect only wears off upon moving.

#### Sharp Shooter

The character becomes able to attack more than 1 target at the same time without
applying Disadvantage or Inferiority roll modifiers.

#### True Sight

When attacking with a long-range weapon, the maximum range limit is increased by
half of the character's Dexterity. If the character's Dexterity is odd, add 1 to
it before dividing by 2.

extra damage to other character within the attack range and who weren't hit yet
on this turn.

#### Urgent Healer

When casting Heal on a target who's below one third of its total Health Points,
apply the Superiority modifier.

When a critical roll happens on a Heal, another character can be chosen to be
targeted by the Heal. The new target must be within the Heal range (from the
caster).

#### Brave Medic

When casting Heal on someone else from a distance of 1m, add one third of the
character's Magicy to the amount healed.

#### Dispellary

another mark whose level is lesser than the first one's. This second mark
dispell does not trigger Dispellary.

to succeed.
