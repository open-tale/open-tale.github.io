# 7. Combat

The combat flow is as follows:

1. Resolve unexpected encounters, if any;
2. Define combat order;
3. Characters take circular turns to choose what to do until the battle ends.

On each turn of the step 3, the players can do the following actions in any
order:

* Spend a Heroic Badge;
* Move their characters;
* Switch weapons or shield;
* Perform an attack or use a skill or consume an item;
* Schedule a wearable gear switch;
* Defend.

Unless explicitly told otherwise by a perk or a skill, it's forbidden to do the
same action twice in a single turn.

Switching wearable gears during combat cannot be done in a single turn. If
character *A* does so, the other gear is removed from the inventory, the current
gear is unequipped and sent to the inventory and the turn ends. In the beginning
of the next character *A*'s turn, the new gear is equipped. Only one wearable
gear switch is allowed per turn.

Upon using the Defend action, the turn ends and the character's Defense is
increased by 1 point until its next turn. The Defend action can only be used in
a turn if:

1. No attack has been made and no skill has been used;
2. The character hasn't schedule a wearable gear switch.
