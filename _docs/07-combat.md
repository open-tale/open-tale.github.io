# 7. Combat

The combat flow is as follows:

1. Resolve unexpected encounters, if any;
2. Define combat order;
3. Characters take circular turns to choose what to do until the battle ends.

On each turn of the step 3, the players can do the following actions in any
order:

* Spend an Heroic Badge;
* Move their characters;
* Switch weapons or shield;
* Perform an attack or use a skill;
* Schedule a wearable gear switch.

Switching wearable gears during combat cannot be done in a single turn. When a
player chooses to do so, the gear is instantly unequipped and sent to the
character's inventory. The new gear can be equipped in the beginning of the next
player's turn. Switching wearable gears is still allowed if the character's
inventory is full.
