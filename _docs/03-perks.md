# 3. Perks

## 3.1. Combative perks

#### Thirst for Blood

If an attack made with a close-range weapon brings the target's HP down to 0,
the player may choose another target. Upon choosing it, the character moves
towards it and, if possible, attacks it with another close-range attack.

The path towards the target must be the shortest one. The scores for movement
range and attack damage are calculated with new rolls.

#### Dash Attack

When performing a close-range attack on a target right after moving towards it,
the character gets an extra point on the final score of the roll.

#### Side Slash

When performing a close-range attack on a target right after moving from a cell
that is adjacent to the target to another cell that is also adjacent to the
target, the character gets an extra point on the final score of the roll.

## 3.2. Social perks
