# 2. Characters

Characters are entities that can affect the narrative and interact with each
other (or with the environment). A character can be either a *Player Character*
(PC), which is interpreted by a player, or a *Non-Player Character* (NPC), which
is interpreted by the Game Master.

## 2.1. Character traits

Traits are the characteristics of a character that can be somehow represented
numerically within the Open Tale system. A character can have the following
traits:

* [Level](#211-level)
* [Attributes](#212-attributes)
* [Perks](#213-perks)
* [Qualities](#214-qualities)
* [Wealth](#215-wealth)

### 2.1.1. Level

The character's level expresses how experienced it is in a campaign. Characters
on higher levels are usually tougher in certain aspects.

The level of a character varies from 1 to 9. To level up, the player must spend
3 experience points regardless of the current level of the character.

Players are awarded experience points in the end of each session, usually at
least 1 point.

### 2.1.2. Attributes

Open Tale has the following attributes:

| Attribute | Effects
|:-:|:-:
| **Strength** | swing long weapons, immobilize an enemy, break a door, wear heavy armor, carry items
| **Dexterity** | swing short weapons, use ranged weapons, pick a lock or a pocket, perform first aid
| **Energy** | manifest and control the elements
| **Corruption** | poison foes, open wounds, provoke disabilities and dizziness
| **Divinity** | heal with hands, provide support for allies, protect with heavenly shields
| **Agility** | surprise foes, initiate combat, improve dodging skills
| **Vitality** | heal with potions, increase health points, resist or purge toxicity
| **Persuasion** | negociate better prices, gather privileged information
| **Malice** | induce chaotic mental states such as demoralization, horror and confusion
| **Volition** | perform laborous tasks, display bravery, maintain or recover sanity
| **Awareness** | avoid surprise attacks, notice manipulation
| **Intellect** | solve riddles, decypher codes, understand complex scriptures
| **Motion** | enhance movement capability during combat, jump higher and further

Each attribute varies from 1 to 9. To go from an attribute level *X* to the
next, the player must spend 3*X* attribute points.

The character starts off with 30 attribute points and can recieve more by
advancing on character levels. When going from a character level *Y* to the
next, the character gains 4*Y* attribute points.

### 2.1.3. Perks

Perks are traits that grant constant passive boosts and can be acquired as the
character progresses in the story.

Every character level grants the player the right to purchase one new perk. That
being said, the character starts off with one available perk to purchase.

### 2.1.4. Qualities

Qualities are traits that cannot be changed directly. Instead, they're are the
result of the character's level and attributes, being subject to further
changes.

* **Health Points**: The character's measure of health. When it reaches 0, the
character may die or become unconscious.

* **Capacity**: Maximum number of items that a character may carry.

* **Defense**: The character's ability to protect itself against damage by
dodging it or creating magical shields or simply by absorbing impact with gear.

* **Willpower**: Ability to preserve a healthy psyche, protecting from external
subtle influences.

* **Toughness**: Physical constitution and equilibrium. Protects against
submission, stun, poison, infections and diseases.

See below the formulas to define the base value of each quality:

| Quality | Formula
|:-:|:-:
| **Health Points** | 10 + Level + Vitality
| **Capacity** | 5 + Level + Strength
| **Defense** | 5 + Agility + Divinity
| **Willpower** | 5 + Volition + Awareness
| **Toughness** | Strength + Vitality + Volition

### 2.1.5. Wealth

Wealth relates to what the character can purchase with the in-game money
according to the following rules:

* A character is allowed to buy items that are at their same wealth level or
lower without further consequences;

* It's also possible to buy items that are at 1 wealth level above the
character's wealth by spending 1 wealth point. This is prohibited for characters
with wealth below 2;

* It's not allowed to buy items that are at 2 or more wealth levels above the
character's wealth.

The wealth of a character varies from 1 to 9 and can grow when treasures are
found, rewards are earned or very rare items are sold. Selling regular loot does
not grant wealth.

## 2.2. Creating a character

These are the steps to create a character within the Open Tale system:

1. Spend any of the first 30 attribute points;
2. Choose your initial perk, if you want to do it now;
3. Compute the character's qualities.

The table below displays the total cost of the initial attribute levels:

| Attribute level | Total cost
|:-:|:-:
| 2 | 3
| 3 | 9
| 4 | 18
| 5 | 30
