# 2. Characters

Characters are entities that can affect the narrative and interact with each
other (or with the environment). A character can be either a *Player Character*
(PC), which is interpreted by a player, or a *Non-Player Character* (NPC), which
is interpreted by the Game Master.

## 2.1. Character traits

Traits are the characteristics of a character that can be somehow represented
numerically within the Open Tale system. A character can have the following
traits:

* [Level](#211-level)
* [Attributes](#212-attributes)
* [Qualities](#213-qualities)
* [Perks](#214-perks)
* [Wealth](#215-wealth)

### 2.1.1. Level

The character's level expresses how experienced it is in a campaign. Characters
on higher levels are usually tougher in certain aspects.

The level of a character varies from 1 to 9. To level up, the player must spend
3 experience points regardless of the current level of the character.

Players are awarded experience points in the end of each session, usually at
least 1 point.

### 2.1.2. Attributes

Open Tale has the following attributes:

| Attribute | Exemplary effects
|:-:|:-:
| **Strength** | swing medium and long weapons, parry attacks, wear heavy armor, carry items
| **Dexterity** | use short/ranged weapons, dodge/deflect attacks, pick locks or pockets, wear leather armor
| **Magicy** | aptitude for supportive and offensive magic
| **Motion** | movement capability during combat, run faster, jump higher
|~|~
| **Vitality** | enhance the efficiency of potions, increase health points, resist toxicity
| **Alertness** | avoid surprise attacks, spot traps, notice mental manipulation
| **Volition** | perform laborous tasks, display bravery, maintain sanity
|~|~
| **Persuasion** | negotiate better prices, gather privileged information, tell a lie
| **Intellect** | solve riddles, decypher codes, understand old scriptures
| **Wisdom** | have impactful insights, read feelings of others, display common sense

Each attribute varies from 1 to 9. To go from an attribute level to the next,
say *X*, the cost is *X* attribute points.

The character starts off with 20 attribute points and can recieve more by
advancing on character levels. When going from a character level to the next,
say *Y*, the character is awarded with *Y* + 1 attribute points.

### 2.1.3. Qualities

Qualities are traits that cannot be changed directly. Instead, they're are the
result of the character's level and attributes, being subject to further
changes.

* **Health Points**: The character's measure of health. When it reaches 0,
the character may become unconscious or die;

* **Capacity**: Maximum number of non-equiped items that a character may
carry;

* **Defense**: The character's ability to protect itself from damage by
deflecting/dodging attacks or simply absorbing impact with gear;

* **Toughness**: Physical constitution, equilibrium and resilience.
Protects from poison, illnesses and disabilities.

* **Willpower**: Ability to preserve a healthy psyche, protecting from
external subtle influences.

See below the formulas to define the base value of each quality:

| Quality | Formula
|:-:|:-:
| **Health Points** | 10 + Level + 2 * Vitality
| **Capacity** | 10 + Level + Strength
| **Defense** | 5 + Strength + Dexterity
| **Toughness** | 5 + Volition + Vitality
| **Willpower** | 5 + Volition + Alertness

### 2.1.4. Perks

Perks are combative abilities that can be purchased at anytime outside combat
during the campaign. Every character may choose **three** perks. An extensive
list of perks can be found on the [chapter 4](04-perks).

### 2.1.5. Wealth

Wealth relates to what the character can purchase with the in-game money
according to the following rules:

* A character is allowed to buy items that are at their same wealth level or
lower without further consequences;

* It's also possible to buy items that are at 1 wealth level above the
character's wealth by spending 1 wealth point. This is prohibited for characters
with wealth below 2;

* It's not allowed to buy items that are at 2 or more wealth levels above the
character's wealth.

The wealth of a character varies from 1 to 9 and can grow when treasures are
found, rewards are earned or very rare items are sold. Selling regular loot does
not grant wealth.

## 2.2. Creating a character

These are the steps to create a character within the Open Tale system:

1. Spend any of the first 20 attribute points;
2. Compute the character's qualities;
3. Choose the character's perks, if intended;
4. Set the initial wealth to 1.

The table below displays the total cost of the initial attribute levels:

| Attribute level | Total cost | Detailed cost
|:-:|:-:|:-:
| 2 | 2 | 2
| 3 | 5 | 2 + 3
| 4 | 9 | 2 + 3 + 4
| 5 | 14 | 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
| 6 | 20 | 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6
