# 2. Characters

Characters are entities that can affect the narrative and interact with each
other (or with the environment). A character can be either a *Player Character*
(PC), which is interpreted by a player, or a *Non-Player Character* (NPC), which
is interpreted by the Game Master.

## 2.1. Character traits

Traits are the characteristics of a character that can be somehow represented
numerically within the Open Tale system. A character can have the following
traits:

* [Level](#211-level)
* [Attributes](#212-attributes)
* [Qualities](#213-qualities)
* [Skills](#214-Skills)
* [Wealth](#215-wealth)

### 2.1.1. Level

The character's level expresses how experienced it is in a campaign. Characters
on higher levels are usually tougher in certain aspects.

The level of a character varies from 1 to 9. To level up, the player must spend
3 experience points regardless of the current level of the character.

Players are awarded experience points in the end of each session, usually at
least 1 point. The benefits of leveling up are shown on the following
subsessions.

### 2.1.2. Attributes

Open Tale has the following attributes:

| Attribute | Exemplary effects
|:-:|:-:
| **Strength** | swing medium and long weapons, parry attacks, carry items
| **Dexterity** | use short/ranged weapons, dodge/deflect attacks, pick locks or pockets
| **Magicy** | aptitude for supportive and offensive magic
| **Motion** | movement capability during combat, run faster, jump higher
|~|~
| **Vitality** | enhance the efficiency of potions, increase health points, resist toxicity
| **Perception** | avoid surprise attacks, spot traps, notice mental manipulation
| **Volition** | perform laborous tasks, display bravery, resist pain, maintain sanity
|~|~
| **Persuasion** | negotiate better prices, intimidate characters, tell a convincing lie
| **Intellect** | solve riddles, decypher codes, understand old scriptures
| **Wisdom** | have impactful insights, display common sense

Each attribute varies from 1 to 9. To go from an attribute level to the next,
say *X*, the cost is *X* attribute points. For instance, the cost to go from an
attribute level 6 to 7 is 7 attribute points.

The character starts off with 20 attribute points and can recieve more by
advancing on character levels. When a character advances in level, he is awarded
with his new level plus 1 attribute points. For instance, going from level 3 to
level 4 grants the character 5 attribute points (4 + 1).

### 2.1.3. Qualities

Qualities are traits that cannot be changed directly. Instead, they're are the
result of the character's level and attributes, being subject to further
changes.

* **Health Points**: The character's measure of health. When it reaches 0,
the character may become unconscious or die;

* **Capacity**: Maximum number of non-equiped items that a character may
carry;

* **Defense**: The character's ability to protect itself from damage by
deflecting/dodging attacks or simply absorbing impact with gear;

* **Toughness**: Physical constitution, equilibrium and resilience.
Protects from poison, illnesses and disabilities.

* **Resolve**: Ability to preserve a healthy psyche, protecting from
external subtle influences.

See below the formulas to define the base value of each quality:

| Quality | Formula
|:-:|:-:
| **Health Points** | 10 + Level + 2 * Vitality
| **Capacity** | 10 + Level + Strength
| **Defense** | 5 + Strength + Dexterity
| **Toughness** | 5 + Volition + Vitality
| **Resolve** | 5 + Volition + Perception

### 2.1.4. Skills

Skills are combative abilities that can be purchased at anytime outside combat
during the campaign. A skill can be acquired by spending a skill point.

Every character starts with two skill points and is rewarded with an extra skill
point on every **even** level. Below you find a table that shows the maximum
number of skills that a character may have by level:

| **Level** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
| **Maximum number of skills** | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 6 | 6

### 2.1.5. Wealth

Wealth relates to what the character can purchase with the in-game money
according to the following rules:

* A character is allowed to buy items that are at their same wealth level or
lower without further consequences;

* It's also possible to buy items that are at 1 wealth level above the
character's wealth by spending 1 wealth point. This is prohibited for characters
with wealth below 2;

* It's not allowed to buy items that are at 2 or more wealth levels above the
character's wealth.

The wealth of a character varies from 1 to 9 and can grow when treasures are
found, rewards are earned or very rare items are sold. Selling regular loot does
not grant wealth.

## 2.2. Creating a character

These are the steps to create a character within the Open Tale system:

1. Define its looks, personality and name;
2. Spend any of the initial attribute points;
3. Compute the character's qualities;
4. Spend any of the initial skill points;
5. Set the initial wealth to 1.

**Note**: For Magicy based characters, it's fundamental to learn at least one
active skill in the very beginning of the journey.

The table below displays the total cost of the initial attribute levels:

| Attribute level | Total cost | Detailed cost
|:-:|:-:|:-:
| 2 | 2 | 2
| 3 | 5 | 2 + 3
| 4 | 9 | 2 + 3 + 4
| 5 | 14 | 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
| 6 | 20 | 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6
