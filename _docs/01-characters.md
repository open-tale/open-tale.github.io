* *Level*

### Qualities

Qualities are traits that cannot be changed directly. Instead, they're are the
result of the character's level and attributes, being subject to further
changes.

* **Health Points**: The character's measure of health. When it reaches 0, the
character may die or become unconscious.

* **Capacity**: Maximum number of items that a character may carry.

* **Defense**: The character's ability to protect itself against damage by
dodging it or creating magical shields or simply by absorbing impact with gear.

* **Willpower**: Ability to preserve a sane mental state, protecting against
harmful mental influences.

* **Poise**: Physical constitution and equilibrium. Protects against submission,
poison, infections and diseases.

See below the formulas to define the base value of each quality:

| Quality | Formula
|:-:
| **Health Points** | 10 + Level + Vitality
| **Capacity** | 5 + Level + Strength
| **Defense** | 5 + Agility + Creation
| **Willpower** | 5 + Volition + Awareness
| **Poise** | 5 + Strength + Vitality

### Perks

Perks are characteristics that grant constant passive boosts and can be acquired
as the character progresses in the story.

### Wealth

Wealth relates to what the character can purchase with the in-game money
according to the following rules:

* A character is allowed to buy items that are at their same wealth level or
lower without further consequences;
* It's also possible to buy items that are at 1 wealth level above the
character's wealth by spending 1 wealth point;
* It's not allowed to buy items that are at 2 or more wealth levels above the
character's wealth.
