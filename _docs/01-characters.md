# 1. Characters

Characters are entities that can affect the narrative and interact with each
other (or with the environment). A character can have the following traits:

* *Level*
* *Attributes*
* *Perks*
* *Qualities*
* *Wealth*

#### Level

The character's level expresses how experienced it is in a campaign. Characters
on higher levels are usually tougher in certain aspects.

The level of a character varies from 1 to 10. To level up, the player must spend
3 experience points regardless of the current level of the character.

Players are awarded experience points in the end of each session, usually at
least 1 point.

#### Attributes

Open Tale has the following attributes:

| Attribute | Active effects | Passive effects
|:-:
| **Strength** | swing medium and long weapons, wrestle an enemy to submission | wear heavy armor, carry items
| **Dexterity** | swing short weapons, use ranged weapons, pick a lock or a pocket, perform first aid
| **Destruction** | use elemental attacks, summon arcane magic
| **Creation** | heal with hands | summon shields with magic
| **Agility** | surprise foes, combat initiative | dodging skills
| **Vitality** | heal with potions | number of health points, resistance to toxicity
| **Persuasion** | convince other characters, haggle good prices, influence characters with thoughts
| **Volition** | face challenges that require mental resilience | display bravery, maintain sanity
| **Awareness** | avoid surprise attacks, spot traps | notice manipulation
| **Intellect** | solve riddles, decypher codes, understand complex scriptures
| **Speed** | movement capability when on feet during combat

Each attribute varies from 1 to 10. To go from an attribute level *X* to the
next, the player must spend 3*X* attribute points.

The character starts off with 30 attribute points and can recieve more by
advancing on character levels. When going from a character level *Y* to the
next, the character gains 4*Y* attribute points.

#### Perks

Perks are characteristics that grant constant passive boosts and can be acquired
as the character progresses in the story.

#### Qualities

Qualities are traits that cannot be changed directly. Instead, they're are the
result of the character's level and attributes, being subject to further
changes.

* **Health Points**: The character's measure of health. When it reaches 0, the
character may die or become unconscious.

* **Capacity**: Maximum number of items that a character may carry.

* **Defense**: The character's ability to protect itself against damage by
dodging it or creating magical shields or simply by absorbing impact with gear.

* **Willpower**: Ability to preserve a healthy psyche, protecting from external
subtle influences.

* **Poise**: Physical constitution and equilibrium. Protects against submission,
stun, poison, infections and diseases.

See below the formulas to define the base value of each quality:

| Quality | Formula
|:-:
| **Health Points** | 10 + Level + Vitality
| **Capacity** | 5 + Level + Strength
| **Defense** | 5 + Agility + Creation
| **Willpower** | 5 + Volition + Awareness
| **Poise** | 5 + Strength + Vitality

#### Wealth

Wealth relates to what the character can purchase with the in-game money
according to the following rules:

* A character is allowed to buy items that are at their same wealth level or
lower without further consequences;
* It's also possible to buy items that are at 1 wealth level above the
character's wealth by spending 1 wealth point;
* It's not allowed to buy items that are at 2 or more wealth levels above the
character's wealth.
