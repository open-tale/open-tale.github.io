# 3. Roll system

Every player roll in Open Tale is based on an attribute, for which the final
score is the sum of 2d6 and the respective attribute level. It's that simple!

## 3.1. Heroism

The GM can reward characters with *Heroic Badges*, which can be spent during
combat in the character's turn. If the player chooses so, every upcoming roll on
that turn happens with an extra d4.

Characters cannot carry more than one Heroic Badge at a time.

## 3.2. Roll modifiers

Roll modifiers are ingredients that can be used to spice up the story in certain
moments. There are two **mutually exclusive** roll modifiers in Open Tale:
*Disadvantage* and *Advantage*.

* Disadvantage: roll again and stay with the lowest score
* Advantage: roll again and stay with the highest score

Some circumstances tell you exactly which modifier to apply, but the GM is free
to say which modifier should be used throughout the game.
