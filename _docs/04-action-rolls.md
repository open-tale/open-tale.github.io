# 4. Action rolls

Action rolls have two fundamental purposes in Open Tale:

* Resolve *conflicts of interests* between characters;
* Surpass challenges proposed by the GM.

So, for example, if character *A* is attacking character *B*, there exists a
conflict of interest regarding the damage that can be dealt.
