# 4. Action rolls

Action rolls have two fundamental purposes in Open Tale:

* Resolve *conflicts of interests* between characters;
* Surpass challenges proposed by the GM.

So, for example, if a character is attacking another, there exists a conflict of
interest regarding the damage that can be dealt. Or if a character is trying to
pick the lock of a treasure chest, the GM needs to define the minimum score to
open it.

It is recommended for the GM to drive the story in a way that every roll
matters. In other words, failing at challenges should not result in empty
outcomes. "So I try to open it again...", how fun is that? Instead, try to lead
the party to unexpected situations as in "You hear the lock crack open, but you
feel the rise of an intimidating presence behind you" or "You hear a strange
sound coming from the lock and now you're unable to manouver it because it's
completely stuck".

## 4.1. Types of actions

Players roll dice in Open Tale for 6 major reasons:

1. To deal damage;
2. To surpass a challenge score;
3. To support allies;
4. To avoid surprises;
5. To define combat order;
6. To move during combat.

Items 4 to 6 will be covered in the next chapter, [Combat](05-combat). For now,
let's understand the first 3.
