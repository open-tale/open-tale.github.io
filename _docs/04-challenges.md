# 4. Challenges

In a very broad sense, the purpose of dice rolls in Open Tale is for the
characters to overcome challenges. So, in order to know the contexts in which
players can roll dice, we need to understand the types of challenges that Open
Tale supports.

There are seven different types of challenge in Open Tale:

* [Environmental challenges](#41-environmental-challenges)
* [Surprise encounters](#42-surprise-encounters)
* Defining combat order
* Dealing damage
* Healing damage
* Removing debuffs
* Moving during combat

## 4.1. Environmental challenges

These are challenges in which characters don't interact with other characters.
Instead, they interact with elements in the scenario. Here are some examples of
environmental challenges:

| Challenge | Roll for
|:-:|:-:
| Pick a lock | Dexterity
| Break a door | Strength
| Slide below a closing door | Motion
| Move a rigid lever | Strength
| Jump over a chasm | Motion

## 4.2. Surprise encounters
