# 4. Challenges

In a very broad sense, the purpose of dice rolls in Open Tale is for the
characters to overcome challenges. So, in order to know the contexts in which
players can roll dice, we need to understand the types of challenges that Open
Tale supports.

## 4.1. Predefined challenges

These are challenges in which characters don't interact with other characters.
Instead, they interact with elements in the scenario. Here we have some examples
of environmental challenges:

| Challenge | Roll for
|:-:|:-:
| Pick a lock | Dexterity
| Break a door | Strength
| Move a rigid lever | Strength
| Slide below a closing gate | Motion
| Jump over a chasm | Motion
| Gather clues from an old book | Intellect
| Stay awake on watch | Volition

A predefined challenge has an intrinsic *Challenge Rating* (CR), which is
designed by the GM. To succeed in a challenge like this the obtained score must
be greater than the CR.

## 4.2. Unexpected encounters

When characters are forced into combat without previously noticing the presence
of enemies, a surprise encounter happens. Characters that appeared out of the
blue roll for Dexterity and the ones that weren't expecting the encounter roll
for Alertness. The GM decides how to choose the characters that were surprised.

## 4.3. Defining combat order

All characters involved in the combat should draw their weapons and roll for
Agility. If there were an unexpected encounter, the characters that have already
rolled for Agility are not allowed to roll again. Surprised characters just
compete between themselves for combat initiative in the end of the combat queue.
In the event of a tie, the GM decides the combat order.

## 4.4. Moving during combat

Movement during combat is pretty straightforward. Roll for Motion and the
obtained score represents the maximum distance that the character can move.

## 4.5. Dealing direct damage

Challenges that involve direct damage require rolls for Strength or Dexterity.
The obtained score is called *Attack Power* (AP), which is subtracted by the
Defense of the target and the result may cause direct damage to the target. If
the difference is smaller than 1, a complete defense happens and no damage is
done. It's important to notice that the AP may be influenced by the usage of
certain equipment, like daggers, swords or bows.

#### Damage regarding the range

* For close-range attacks (swords, clubs, axes, daggers), the distance must not
be greater than 1m;

* For long-range attacks (bows, slingshots, shurikens), the maximum distance
allowed between the character and the target is 5 + Dexterity, in meters.

#### Damage regarding the number of targets

* When attacking 2 enemies at the same time, the Disadvantage modifier should be
applied;

* For 3 enemies or more, besides applying the Disadvantage modifier, decrease 1
from the AP for each targeted enemy that exceeds 2. For instance, when attacking
5 enemies at the same time, apply the Disadvantage modifier **and** decrease the
AP by 3 (5 - 2);

* Close-range attacks can hit as many targets within the 1m range as intended;

* Long-range attacks can only hit more than one character if they are perfectly
aligned;

* When attacking more than one enemy, the targets within the area of effect can
be selected anyhow.

## 4.6. Using potions

Using a potion requires roll for Vitality.

* If the potion has the effect to remove some mark, the final roll score must be
greater then the mark level for the potion to work.

* If the potion heals Health Points, the amount healed is equal to one third of
the final roll score.

## 4.7. Overcoming impairments

Overcoming an impairment means to attempt to remove a mark and requires a roll
for Volition.

* If the final roll score is below the mark level, the character's next roll
will be subject to the Disadvantage modifier;

* Otherwise, the mark is removed.

## 4.8. Using an active skill

The potence of an active skill is represented by its *Skill Power* (SP), which
depends on the attribute to roll for. Such attribute can be one of the
followings: Strength, Dexterity or Magicy.

If the skill requires a roll for Strength or Dexterity, the SP is defined by the
AP, just like when dealing direct damage. If, instead, the skill requires a roll
for Magicy, the SP is defined by the *Magical Power* (MP), which is equal to the
final score of the roll and can be changed by some equipment, like a wand or a
staff.
