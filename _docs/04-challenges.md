# 4. Challenges

In a very broad sense, the purpose of dice rolls in Open Tale is for the
characters to overcome challenges. So, in order to know the contexts in which
players can roll dice, we need to understand the types of challenges that Open
Tale supports.

These are the different types of challenges in Open Tale:

* [Predefined challenges](#41-predefined-challenges)
* [Unexpected encounters](#43-unexpected-encounters)
* [Defining combat order](#44-defining-combat-order)
* [Moving during combat](#45-moving-during-combat)
* [Dealing direct damage](#46-dealing-direct-damage)
* [Using skills](#47-using-skills)

## 4.1. Predefined challenges

These are challenges in which characters don't interact with other characters.
Instead, they interact with elements in the scenario. Here we have some examples
of environmental challenges:

| Challenge | Roll for
|:-:|:-:
| Pick a lock | Dexterity
| Break a door | Strength
| Move a rigid lever | Strength
| Slide below a closing gate | Motion
| Jump over a chasm | Motion
| Gather clues from an old book | Intellect
| Stay awake on watch | Volition

The difficulty of such challenges are predefined by the GM.

## 4.3. Unexpected encounters

When characters are forced into combat without previously noticing the presence
of enemies, a surprise encounter happens. Characters that appeared out of the
blue (group *A*) roll for Dexterity and the ones that weren't expecting the
encounter (group *B*) roll for Awareness. The GM decides how to choose the
characters that were surprised.

## 4.4. Defining combat order

All characters involved in the combat should draw their weapons and roll for
Agility. If there were an unexpected encounter, the characters that have already
rolled for Agility are not allowed to roll again. Surprised characters just
compete between themselves for combat initiative in the end of the combat queue.
The tiebreaker criteria follow the order below:

1. Close-range weapons have advantage over long-range/magical weapons;
2. Small weapons have advantage over long weapons;
3. Light armor has advantage over heavy armor;
4. The character with the highest Agility wins;
5. The GM decides!

## 4.5. Moving during combat

Movement during combat is pretty straightforward. Roll for Motion and the
obtained score represents the maximum distance that the character can move.

## 4.6. Dealing direct damage

Challenges that involve direct damage manifest as rolls for Strength, Dexterity
and Energy. In any case, the obtained score is subtracted by the Defense of the
target character and the difference results in direct damage. If the difference
is smaller than 1, then no damage is done.

#### Damage regarding the range

* For close-range attacks (swords, clubs, axes, daggers), the distance must not
be greater than 1m.

* For long-range attacks (bows and elemental magic), there is a distance from
which the attack loses effectiveness. Such distance is equal to the obtained
score on the roll. For distances greater than that, the damage is reduced by 1
for each meter further.

    Example: the roll to shoot a bow resulted in a score of 12, the enemy has 6
    points of Defense and is placed at a distance of 14m from the shooter. If it
    weren't for the range, the attack would have dealt 6 points of damage (12 -
    6), but the target is 2 meters further away from the range limit so the
    final damage is 4 (6 - 2).

* For skills, going past the range limit is simply prohibitive.

#### Damage regarding the number of targets

* When targeting 2 enemies at the same time, the Disadvantage midifier should be
applied;

* For 3 enemies or more, the Inferiority modifier should be applied.

* Skills can only target one character at a time.

#### Damage regarding the area of effect

* Close-range attacks can be highly selective, meaning that the attacker can
choose the exact targets within 1m;

* Long-range attacks performed with Dexterity can only go in straight lines,
hitting everyone between the attacker and the target;

* Long-range attacks performed with Energy can have three shapes:

    * Circular and radial: hits everyone until a certain range

    * Circular and non-radial: hits a target and everyone near it

    * Straight line: hits everyone between the attacker and the target

* **Beware of friendly fire**

## 4.7. Using skills

Every skill is related to a main attribute
