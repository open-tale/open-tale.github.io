# 4. Challenges

In a very broad sense, the purpose of dice rolls in Open Tale is for the
characters to overcome challenges. So, in order to know the contexts in which
players can roll dice, we need to understand the types of challenges that Open
Tale supports.

But before we go deeper, let's first define the term *Challenge Rating* (CR).
Challenge ratings are the minimum scores to overcome challenges whose outcomes
are *yes* or *no*. Of course the GM is free to tweak the output of the challenge
according to the score achieved by the character.

Moving on... these are the different types of challenges in Open Tale:

* [Environmental challenges](#41-environmental-challenges)
* [Unexpected encounters](#42-unexpected-encounters)
* [Defining combat order](#43-defining-combat-order)
* [Dealing direct damage](#44-dealing-direct-damage)
* [Healing damage](#45-applying-debuffs)
* [Applying debuffs](#46-applying-debuffs)
* Cleansing debuffs
* Moving during combat

## 4.1. Environmental challenges

These are challenges in which characters don't interact with other characters.
Instead, they interact with elements in the scenario. Here are some examples of
environmental challenges:

| Challenge | Roll for
|:-:|:-:
| Pick a lock | Dexterity
| Break a door | Strength
| Move a rigid lever | Strength
| Slide below a closing gate | Motion
| Jump over a chasm | Motion
| Gather clues from an old book | Intellect
| Stay awake on watch | Volition

These challenges have CRs predefined by the GM.

## 4.2. Unexpected encounters

When characters are forced into combat without previously noticing the presence
of enemies, a surprise encounter happens. Characters that appeared out of the
blue roll for Agility and the characters that weren't expecting the encounter
roll for Awareness. The GM decides how to choose the characters that were
surprised.

## 4.3. Defining combat order

All characters involved in the combat should draw their weapons and roll for
Agility. If there were an unexpected encounter, the characters that have already
rolled for Agility are not allowed to roll again. Surprised characters just
compete between themselves for combat initiative. The tiebreaker criteria follow
the order below:

1. Close-range weapons have advantage over long-range weapons;
2. Small weapons have advantage over long weapons;
3. Light armor has advantage over heavy armor;
4. The character with the highest Agility wins.

If there is still ambiguity regarding the combat order, tied characters roll
d20s until the tie ends.

## 4.4. Dealing direct damage

Challenges that involve direct damage manifest as rolls for Strength, Dexterity
and Energy. In any case, the obtained score is subtracted by the Defense of the
target character and the difference results in direct damage. If the difference
is smaller than 1, then no damage is done.

#### Damage regarding the range

For close-range attacks (swords, clubs, axes, daggers), the distance must not be
greater than 1m.

For long-range attacks (bows, slingshots, throwing knives), there is a distance
from which the attack loses effectiveness. Such distance is equal to the
obtained score on the roll. For distances greater than that, the damage is
reduced by 1 for each meter further. Example: the roll to shoot a bow resulted
in a score of 12, the enemy has 6 points of Defense and is placed at a distance
of 14m from the shooter. If it weren't for the range, the attack would have
dealt 6 points of damage (12 - 6), but the target is 2 meters further away from
the range mark so the final damage is 4 (4 - 2).

#### Damage regarding the number of targets

When targeting 2 enemies at the same time, the character rolls with the
Disadvantage modifier. For 3 targets or more, the Inferiority modifier should be
applied.

Close-range attacks can multi-target any number of enemies within the 1m range.
Long-range attacks, however, can only multi-target enemies in a straight line.
The degree of perfection for diagonal alignment is up to the GM.

## 4.5. Healing damage

## 4.6. Applying debuffs

Debuffs have the maximum duration of one cycle, unless
