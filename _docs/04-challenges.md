# 4. Challenges

In a very broad sense, the purpose of dice rolls in Open Tale is for the
characters to overcome challenges. So, in order to know the contexts in which
players can roll dice, we need to understand the types of challenges that Open
Tale supports.

## 4.1. Predefined challenges

These are challenges in which characters don't interact with other characters.
Instead, they interact with elements in the scenario. Here we have some examples
of environmental challenges:

| Challenge | Roll for
|:-:|:-:
| Pick a lock | Dexterity
| Break a door | Strength
| Move a rigid lever | Strength
| Slide below a closing gate | Motion
| Jump over a chasm | Motion
| Gather clues from an old book | Intellect
| Stay awake on watch | Volition

The difficulty of such challenges are predefined by the GM.

## 4.2. Unexpected encounters

When characters are forced into combat without previously noticing the presence
of enemies, a surprise encounter happens. Characters that appeared out of the
blue roll for Dexterity and the ones that weren't expecting the encounter roll
for Alertness. The GM decides how to choose the characters that were surprised.

## 4.3. Defining combat order

All characters involved in the combat should draw their weapons and roll for
Agility. If there were an unexpected encounter, the characters that have already
rolled for Agility are not allowed to roll again. Surprised characters just
compete between themselves for combat initiative in the end of the combat queue.
In the event of a tie, the GM decides the combat order.

## 4.4. Moving during combat

Movement during combat is pretty straightforward. Roll for Motion and the
obtained score represents the maximum distance that the character can move.

## 4.5. Dealing direct damage

Challenges that involve direct damage require rolls for Strength or Dexterity.
In any case, the obtained score is subtracted by the Defense of the target
and the result causes direct damage. If the difference is smaller than 1, a
complete defense happens and no damage is done.

#### Damage regarding the range

* For close-range attacks (swords, clubs, axes, daggers), the distance must not
be greater than 1m;

* For long-range attacks (bows, slingshots, shurikens), the maximum distance
allowed between the character and the target is 10 + Dexterity, in meters.

#### Damage regarding the number of targets

* When attacking 2 enemies at the same time, the Disadvantage modifier should be
applied;

* For 3 enemies or more, the Inferiority modifier should be applied;

* Close-range attacks can hit as many targets within the 1m range as intended;

* Long-range attacks can only hit more than one character if they are perfectly
aligned;

* When attacking more than one enemy, the targets within the area of effect can
be selected anyhow.

## 4.6. Using potions

Using a potion requires roll for Vitality.

* If the potion has the effect to remove some mark, the final roll score must be
greater then the mark level for the potion to work.

* If the potion heals Health Points, the amount healed is equal to one third of
the final roll score.

## 4.7. Using skills

A skill requires a roll score of a certain attribute to account as its *Skill
Power* (SP). An extensive list of the available skills can be found on the next
chapter.
