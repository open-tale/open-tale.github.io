# 1. Introduction

Open Tale is not a game per se... it's a system to build stories with. What this
means is that the GM and the players are free to compose their own atmosphere.
For instance: when players are creating their characters, they can go in as much
detail as they like, be it in terms of personality of physical appearance.
However, this website focuses as much as possible on the system itself, leaving
the rest for your imagination.

Although Open Tale focuses on providing a fair system with interesting
mathematical unfoldings, there must be a strong commitment to simplicity,
dynamism and flexibility. When we're gathered around a table to play RPGs, we
want to be amazed by innovative stories and epic battles. We want to feel the
impact of great challenges. We want to laugh and be surprised.

Such emotions require a certain timing that can easily be lost if the players
have to constantly check the ruleset to make sure that nobody is breaking the
system. Therefore, Open Tale is aligned with a call for uninterruptible fun.
