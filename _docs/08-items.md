# 8. Items

There are two kinds of items in Open Tale, gears and objects. The distinction
between them is fairly simple: gears can be equiped and objects cannot.

The number of non-equiped items that a character can carry is determined by
the Capacity quality. Also, characters can only carry one bulky/dense item at a
time. If the carried item is too big, the character becomes unable to perform
combative moves. If the item is just too heavy, such as gold bars, the
Disadvantage modifier should be applied on all rolls. But ultimately, these
decisions are up to the GM.

## 6.1. Gears

Since gears can alter the capabilities of characters when equiped, they deserve
special attention. First, gears may have descriptions indicating changes on the
character's attributes, attack, defense, range limit etc when equiped. Second,
as in most RPGs, there are weapons and wearable gears. Let's see how weapons
work.

### 6.1.1. Weapons

Weapons have two basic properties: range and size. They determine whether the
weapon can be used for dual wielding or not, if two hands are required to use it
and the attribute to roll for when attacking with the weapon:

| Range | Size | Dual wield | Two-handed | Roll for | Example
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
| Short | Medium | Yes | No | Strength | Katana, Mace
| Short | Long | No | Yes | Strength | Long Sword, Magic Staff
| Short | Short | Yes | No | Dexterity | Dagger, Knife
| Long | ~ | No | Yes | Dexterity | Bow

When dual wielding weapons of different sizes, the player should roll for the
smallest attribute between his character's Strength and Dexterity.
