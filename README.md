# Open Tale

Welcome to the Open Tale website repository!

## Serving locally

This website is generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the
[github-pages](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) gem. After installing them,
you can start a local server with:

```bash
# depending on your setup, you run either
jekyll serve
# or
bundle exec jekyll serve
# there is a `make serve` directive as a shortcut for the later
```
